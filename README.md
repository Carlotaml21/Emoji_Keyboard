## Project Description

This project is an **Emoji Keyboard** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The purpose of this project is to provide a virtual keyboard that allows users to interact with emojis.

### Features:
- **HTML & CSS**: The layout and design of the keyboard are built using basic HTML structure and CSS for styling.
- **JavaScript**:
