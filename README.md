# Emoji_Keyboard

## Project Description

This project is an **Emoji Keyboard** designed to display a dynamic sequence of animal emojis. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the virtual keyboard allows users to watch as animal emojis appear and disappear automatically on the screen.

### Features:
- **HTML & CSS**: The keyboard layout is created using basic HTML, and the styling of the emojis and their arrangement on the screen is handled with CSS.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Emojis appear one by one in a sequence and disappear in the same manner, providing a visually dynamic experience.
  - **Visual Interactivity**: Although the emojis are not interactive on click, their appearance and disappearance create an engaging visual experience for the user.

The emojis are displayed automatically, with JavaScript controlling their sequential appearance and disappearance, creating a fun and animated atmosphere.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Watch as the emojis appear one by one and disappear automatically.
3. **Visual Experience**: The emojis continue to show in sequence without any user interaction required.

## Technologies Used
